As part of the data migration process, the Nautilus DevOps team is actively creating several storage containers on Azure. They plan to utilize private Blob containers to store the relevant data. Given the ongoing migration of other infrastructure to Azure, it is logical to consolidate data storage within the Azure environment as well.

Create a new storage account named datacenterst7588 and a private Blob container named datacenter-blob-3020 within the storage account.


Approach:
1. Go to portal.azure.com
2. Search for storage account service and click on create
