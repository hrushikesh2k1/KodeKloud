The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up a new Virtual Machine (VM) on the Azure cloud that can be accessed securely from their landing host (azure-client). Follow the steps below to complete this task:

Create an SSH Key: On the azure-client host, check if an SSH key already exists. If it doesn’t exist, create a new SSH key on the azure-client host that will be used for password-less SSH access.

Create a Virtual Machine: Use the Azure Portal or Azure CLI to create a new Virtual Machine named devops-vm in the westus region. Set the VM size to Standard_B1s and configure the VM with SSH access for the azureuser account using the newly created SSH key.

Configure SSH Access: Ensure that the SSH key from the azure-client host is added to the azureuser account on devops-vm, enabling secure, password-less SSH access from the azure-client host.

Verify Connectivity: Test the connection from azure-client to devops-vm using SSH to confirm that password-less access has been set up correctly.

Approach:
1. Create the ssh keys
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```
2. Copy the public key
   ```bash
   cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
3. Create the VM with given requirements and select the "Add the existing ssh key" and paste the public key for passwordless login.
4. ssh into created VM from azure client host
   ```bash
   ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa azureuser@ip
   ```
